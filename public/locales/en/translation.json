    "me": "In my previous background I was used to solving problems everyday. When I started to learn programming I found out that dealing with algoritms also involved analizing a problem and finding out the best possible solution. That's why programming is so fun to me and I try to reflect this in every single proyect I'm in. Also I'm a Front End developer but I can do Back End if it's needed.",
